# Los Angeles Earthquake Preparation Tool Script

This script served as the final project for my Intermediate Programming with Python course. I worked along with a multidisciplinary team of my peers to create a project that leveraged many of the Python libraries we learned about in the course along with implementing additional libraries and skills. We developed a program that could be viewed as a proof of concept - descriptive analysis tool on earthquake preparation for the Los Angeles County area of California. We used data from historical earthquakes in the region, potential emergency shelters, income of the region, housing information, and population values. We do not see this tool as is to be utilized in actual practice but more of an exercise in using the skills we learned in the class for a project. We made many assumptions and did not develop a true model but wanted to show what could be done using Python and the various libraries we learned. It is still an interesting topic to investigate and brings up policy related implications.
